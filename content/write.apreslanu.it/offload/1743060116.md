> Careless People is disappointing and revealing, for the same reason: It exposes how Facebook’s leadership, including Wynn-Williams, was complicit in enabling the company’s monopolistic, profiteering, and harmful practices under the guise of doing something good for the world or “teaching politicians” to use social media. It does not reveal anything new from what has already been exposed by rights groups for years; rather, it puts a face to the horrific events and dangerous decisions.

> Despite telling an incomplete story, Careless People is a book that took enormous courage to write. This is Wynn-Williams’ story to tell, and it is an important one. It goes to show that we need many stories — especially from those who still can’t be heard — if we are to meaningfully piece together the complex puzzle of one of the world’s most powerful technology companies.
