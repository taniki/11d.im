title: Do not automate the work you are engaged in, only the materials
---

> Children who have not yet lost much of their sense of wonder and fun have helped us to find an ethic about computing: Do not automate the work you are engaged in, only the materials. If you like to draw, do not automate drawing; rather program your personal computer to give you a new set of paints. If you like to play music, do not build a "player piano": instead program yourself a new kind of instrument.
